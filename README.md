Welcome to Bitshift Open Community! 

## Who are we?

Bitshift Open Community aims to foster young developers who are entering the vast field of Software Developent and Design. We realise the importance of proper guidance for young developers in order to make sure they are able to maintain their level of motivation and enthusiasm without any loss of interest in the art of software development altogether. 

## The origin

Software Development is no exception to the famous saying: "The first step is always the hardest". All of us at some initial point of our development career have been intimidated to a level where we felt quite lost and overwhelmed. We are thus aware of the starting-phase struggles, and this very fact acted as a motivation for us to form an organisation which could guide young college students take that essential first step and ultimately break into the enormous world of software development!

## The ideology

Some of us were lucky enough to have good mentors who could guide us though this realm, and now it's time to return the favour by sharing our knowledge and experience with the young developers entering this field. Software development as a domain, consists of a lot of scattered concepts which has to be learnt on the go. However, the real barrier lies in the initiation process, where we don't even know what and how to start with, be it contributing to a simple project or getting selected into a programme as prestigious as the Google Summer of Code. 

At Bitshift Open Community, we follow a mentor-student topology with focus on building projects that could have a positive impact on our lives besides solving real-life problems. We believe in teaching the students _how to fish_ rather than _feeding it to them_ :')

## Any questions?

Here is a list of some frequently asked questions (FAQs) and their answers, about this initiative and the underlying vision. If you feel there is something we failed to address, you may contact [@viveknigam3003](https://github.com/viveknigam3003) for more details.

### How can I be a part of Bitshift as a student?
As of now, Bitshift Open Community is an invitation based project. We would soon be forming a robust onboarding process, which would help us extend our domain to hundreds of other brilliant students.

### How can I be a part of Bitshift as a mentor?
If you believe you have the motivation to learn and also guide young minds along the way, you may contact us [here](mailto:viveknigam.nigam3@gmail.com) with your motivation and your current skillset, and we shall find a fit student and project for you to mentor.

### Why be a part of Bitshift, when I can directly get involved with large organisations?
As a young community, we allow more room for new ideas through rigorous brainstorming sessions with a talented lot of student developers, who can understand your level and relate to your stuggle, besides guiding you through the various challenges along the way. 

### How will I benefit as a student?
You might be a freshman, a sophomore, or a junior at college, and getting the right guidance from your seniors (developers with bit more knowledge and experience than you) will be an amazing opportunity to learn and grow. 

You will be working on different innovative projects, and also proposing your own projects which could ultimately solve some relevant real-life problem. This way you'll develop critical thinking and analytical skills which are a great asset in builing an original product. 

Every single line of code written by you will have proper credit against your name, which can eventually turn out to be a great addition to your experience and resume :)

### How much of my time will I have to devote as a mentor?
As a mentor, your responsibility shall include guiding the students and unblocking them if they happen to get stuck somewhere. You may do this by explaning the problem in simple terms, guiding them towards relevant material, or brainstorm the solution to their problem so that they may get to see a bigger picture. We estimate that this should take about 5-6 hours/week at max, while 2-3 hours/week on an average of your precious time.
